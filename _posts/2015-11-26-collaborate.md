# Collaborate

**Artists:**

Eco-cultural visionaries! We would love to feature your work on our wine labels in the support system change. Look at our proposed list of wine names and causes, and contact us with your       

**Activists and Social Entrepreneurs:**

Do you know of a great cause to fund? Submit your organization to our team, and raise votes and pre-sales to fund the release of a new cause.

**Winemakers:**

We are a collective of winemakers committed to working in harmony with nature. Industrial irrigated sprayed monoculture is not beautiful. If you seek kindred spirits and have a deep care for your craft and the earth, we'd love to collaborate.

**Land or vineyard owners:**

A new model for community land stewardship is emerging. We are committed to caretaking the sacred places on earth, and dissolving the ideological separation between nature conversation and human settlement. We would love to visit and listen to your story.

**Funders:**

We are not currently seeking financing, but our team has a deep interest in social finance and economic vehicles for system-level transition in all areas. We are always open to new allies.

**Donate:**

Donate here if you are inspired by our work. We direct funds toward what we identify as the most crucial initiatives for system change through the levers of community and symbiosis with nature.

**Corporate and Event Producers:**

We love working with mission-aligned business and event producers to create incredible immersive experiences. We collaborate with a wide network of creative network of artists, chefs, musicians, and performers to show the possibility of humans living into their creative genius.

**Allies and potential collaborators:**

Beautiful beings! Come to any of our footstomping/Beethoven/picnic/potluck parties, contact us by email, or follow us on Facebook if in our ignorance we did not have the grace to recognize your gifts when they showed up at our door in the guise of poor wandering pilgrims.

Spirits of the Forest is not an isolated project fighting to save the world. It is a single cell in a vast family of movements toward 'the more beautiful world our hearts know is possible', a joyful process of co-creating a sexier and more deeply fun life on the other side. Human civilization is deeply traumatized and on the brink of global ecological, economic, and humanitarian catastrophe; we consciously choose to focus our energy on realizing compelling alternatives to systems rooted in fear.
